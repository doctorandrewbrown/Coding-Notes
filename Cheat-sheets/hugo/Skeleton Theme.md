## New "Skeleton" Hugo Site
- ```hugo new theme testSite --themesDir .``` gives a new site, called *testSite* without any theme and containing starter content i.e. dummy posts and pages. Note the "." path to current directory. There is no need to create a site directory first, or use ```hugo new site```. Check this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmMGNsUZ3IM&t=202s).
