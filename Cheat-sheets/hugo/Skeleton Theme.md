## New "Skeleton" Hugo Site
- ```hugo new theme testSite --themesDir .``` gives a new site, called *testSite* without any theme and containing starter content i.e. dummy posts and pages. Note the "." path to current directory. There is no need to create a site directory first, or use ```hugo new site``` as this command creates the whole site.
