# Installing Hugo in Mint
- ```$ hugo version``` to check installed version
- ```$ sudo apt install hugo``` seems to install an old version for some reason.
-  So go [here](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) to get a .deb download file for latest version and check if it's *"extended"* version.
-  Don't forget ```$ sudo apt autopurge hugo``` to remove old version before installing new.
