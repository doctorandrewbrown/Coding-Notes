###  Cloning a github repo
-  In vscode or terminal create new empty directory to receive cloned repo
- cd into directory and 
``` bash
$ git clone <github repo url>
```
- Once files are cloned in terminal you have a copy of the git repository (no need for ```git init``` ) run 
```bash
$ git remote -v 
```
- This will show that the local clone is still set to push/pull from original remote repo
- remove the original remote
``` bash

```
